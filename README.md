## Prerequisites
- **Go** version 1.18 or higher ([Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **Telegram bot token** (from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- **Private Telegram group** for file storage
- **GitHub Account** (optional, for using GitHub Actions)
- **Operating System:** Linux, Windows, or macOS

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Argh94/TeleFilesBot.git
cd TeleFilesBot
```

### 2. Create the Configuration File

In the project root, create a file named `config.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "botUsername": "@YourBotUsername",
  "privateChatID": 123456789,
  "cacheFilePath": "cache.json"
}
```
- **botToken**: The token you received from BotFather.
- **botUsername**: Your bot's username (e.g., @MyTeleFilesBot).
- **privateChatID**: The numeric ID of your private Telegram group (to get it, add the bot to the group and use a bot like [@GetIDsBot](https://t.me/GetIDsBot)).
- **cacheFilePath**: Path to the cache file (default is `cache.json`).

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

### 4. Build the Project
To build a binary for your desired OS and architecture (example: Linux 64-bit):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o output/linux_amd64/TeleFilesBot
```
Replace `linux` and `amd64` with your target OS (`linux`, `windows`, `darwin`) and architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`).

### 5. Run the Bot
For Linux:
```bash
./output/linux_amd64/TeleFilesBot
```
For Windows:
```bash
.\output\windows_amd64\TeleFilesBot.exe
```

### 6. Using GitHub Actions (Optional)
This project supports automatic binary builds via GitHub Actions. The workflow file is at `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository and enable the workflow.
3. After successful runs, download the binary artifacts from the **Actions** section.

## Project Structure

```
TeleFilesBot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go              # Bot main code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json          # Configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache.json           # File info cache
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/              # Built binaries output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod               # Go module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum               # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/   # GitHub Actions workflows
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build.yml
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied in GitHub Actions:**  
  Ensure cache paths are properly cleaned. The provided `build.yml` handles this.

- **BotAPI initialization failed:**  
  Check your bot token in `config.json`. If using a proxy, verify its configuration.

- **File exists in cache:**  
  Make sure the cache cleaning step in `build.yml` runs before restoring the cache.
